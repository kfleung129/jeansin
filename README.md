## Features

Product Display and Categorization: The web app clearly displays products in a grid layout under different categories such as "Home," "Clothing," "Brand," "Sneakers," "Accessories," "Jeans," and "On sales." This allows users to easily browse through different sections and find products they are interested in.

Search and User Account Options: The web app includes a search functionality (icon of a magnifying glass), allowing users to quickly find specific products. Additionally, it provides user account management options (icon of a user), enabling customers to log in, manage their profiles, and keep track of their orders.

Multilingual Support: The web app offers multilingual support, as indicated by the language selection dropdown (showing "English" with a globe icon). This feature enhances accessibility for users from different linguistic backgrounds, making the shopping experience more inclusive.
